At Demuxed 2022, I presented a talk about how I re-built the HTML5 `<video>` element using [Custom Elements] and [WebCodecs].

<script>
import Video from "$lib/components/Video.svelte";
import Iframe from "$lib/components/Iframe.svelte";
</script>

## Motivation

For videos on the web, everything starts with the [HTML `<video>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video):

```html
<video controls src="https://example.com/video.mp4"></video>
```

This gives you a basic but fully functional media player right inside your website or web app:

<video controls src="https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-videos/flower.mp4"></video>

This is fine for short, simple videos. However, when video is a core part of your website's experience,
you'll want more advanced features, such as:

- Serving the same video in multiple qualities, and having the player automatically select the best quality
  based on the user's device capabilities and internet connection.
- Serving live content such as a sports broadcast, a 24/7 news channel, or a gaming livestream.
- Monetizing your videos by inserting advertisements.

These features are generally not natively supported by the `<video>` element.
That's where the [Media Source Extensions ("MSE") API][MSE] comes in: it allows your JavaScript code to
load your media content in any way you see fit (usually by `fetch()`ing it from your server)
and then append the loaded content as small "chunks" to the `<video>` element's buffer.
This API forms the backbone of all major JavaScript players, such as [hls.js], [dash.js], [Shaka Player] and [THEOplayer].

However, over time, we've started to notice some limitations of the MSE API:

- MSE lets you control how your media is _buffered_, but not how it is _played_.
  - There's no way to control when the `<video>` element should start playing.
    Most browsers will initiate playback after a couple of audio and video frames have been buffered and decoded,
    but the precise thresholds varies between browsers.
  - For live streams, it may sometimes be preferable to drop a couple of bad or missing frames, instead of stalling the player.
    However, right now, a JavaScript player can't easily detect or control that.
    Instead, it must handle this "after the fact", i.e. by trying to recover _after_ the `<video>` element starts stalling.
- MSE requires media samples to be carried inside a container format, such as fragmented MP4 or WebM.
  - When the source media uses a different format (e.g. [MPEG-TS]), the JavaScript player must first extract the media samples
    from their original container ("demux") and then put them back into a new container ("mux" or "remux").
    This second step is pure overhead, since MSE will immediately extract those samples out of the new container again.

This is where [WebCodecs] comes in. WebCodecs allows JavaScript players to talk directly with audio and video decoders,
giving it full control over when each audio and video frame should be decoded, and when they should be rendered.
This puts almost all the responsibilities for smooth video playback on the JavaScript player.
